                            <h2>Background</h2>
                            <p>Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering in 2016. The bikes are convenience and easy to use. 
                            The pricing plans include single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. 
                            Annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. 
                            Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. 
                            Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, 
                            the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, 
                            why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics.</p>

                            <h2>Preparation</h2>
                            <p>We used Cyclistic’s historical trip data to analyze and identify trends. 
                                All data are organized and located locally. All data has been reviewed for biases.
                                 Data is licensed and was given proper access permissions.</p>

                                <li>Install and load the necessary packages for later cleaning and analysis. <br>
                                    <span class=""><img src="rpics\1.jpg" alt="" /></span></li>
                                <li>Find and set a working directory. <br>
                                    <span class=""><img src="rpics\2.jpg" alt="" /></span></li>
                                <li>Upload CSV files from the proper directory. <br>
                                    <span class=""><img src="rpics\3.jpg" alt="" /></span></li>
                                <li>Cross checking columns names for matching data. <br>
                                    <span class=""><img src="rpics\4.jpg" alt="" /></span></li>
                                <li>The output shows outdated col names for 2019, we then rename them so that it will be consistent with 2020. <br>
                                    <span class=""><img src="rpics\5.jpg" alt="" /></span></li>
                                <li>Inspect data frames and look for incongruences. <br>
                                    <span class=""><img src="rpics\6.jpg" alt="" /></span></li>
                                <li>‘ride_id’ and ‘rideable_type’ are shown as ‘num’ so we will change that to character using the mutate() function.<br>
                                    <span class=""><img src="rpics\7.jpg" alt="" /></span></li>
                                    <li>Now we combine all four data frames into one and we will call it ‘all_trips’. <br>
                                        <span class=""><img src="rpics\8.jpg" alt="" /></span></li>
                                        <li>We are then going to remove a few outdated columns to make all data congruent with q1_2020<br>
                                            <span class=""><img src="rpics\9.jpg" alt="" style="width:100%;"/></span></li>
                                            <li>Now we will inspect the new table using all the following functions <br>
                                                <span class=""><img src="rpics\10.jpg" alt="" style="width:100%;"/></span></li>
                                                <li>We noticed some inconsistencies in the member_casual column so we summarize the column using table() function.<br>
                                                    <span class=""><img src="rpics\11.jpg" alt="" /></span></li>
                                                    <li>We see that there are multiple labels for members and casual, we will consolidate this into two for future consistency. <br>
                                                        <span class=""><img src="rpics\12.jpg" alt="" /></span></li>
                                                        <li>After checking everything was in order, we now want to add columns that list the date, month, day, year and day_of_week of each ride, having these numbers give us more ways to aggregate our data and it also allows us to have deeper insight of our riders.<br>
                                                            <span class=""><img src="rpics\13.jpg" alt="" style="width:100%;"/></span></li>
                                                            <li>After creating the new columns and checking that they’re all in the correct place and format, we now wants to calculate the ride length of each rider. We use the difftime() function to find the difference between ‘all_trips$ended_at’ and ‘all_trips$started_at’.<br>
                                                                <span class=""><img src="rpics\14.jpg" alt="" /></span></li>

                                                                    <span class=""><img src="rpics\15.jpg" alt="" /></span></li>
                                                                    <li>We want to run calculation using the data in ‘ride_length’, to do so we need to convert ‘ride_length’  to numberic. We check if ‘ride_length’ is a factor first then change it.<br>
                                                                        <span class=""><img src="rpics\16.jpg" alt="" /></span></li>

To do so we must check the data first, then proceed to remove them. Since we are removing data from the data frame, we want to make a copy of said data for organization sake and assign it to ‘all_trip_v2’<br>
                                                                            <span class=""><img src="rpics\17.jpg" alt="" style="width:100%;"/></span></li>

                                                                                <span class=""><img src="rpics\18.jpg" alt="" style="width:100%;"/></span> <br>
                                                                            Or we can condense all the above functions using summary().
                                                                            <span class=""><img src="rpics\18v2.jpg" alt="" /></span></li>
                                                                                <li>Now we want to compare the ride_length of casual riders and member riders, we sue the aggregate() function; we compare all_trips_v2$ride_length to all_trips_v2$member_casual adding FUN= to specify which summary statistic we would like to compare them with. <br>
                                                                                    <span class=""><img src="rpics\19.jpg" alt="" style="width:100%;"/></span></li>
                                                                                    <li>Now we compare casual riders and member riders using ‘ride_length’, ‘member_casual’, and ‘day_of_week’.<br>
                                                                                        <span class=""><img src="rpics\20.jpg" alt="" style="width:100%;"/></span></li>
                                                                                        <li>The output shows us that ‘day_of_week’ is out of order, we want to fix this by reassigning ‘day_of_week’ using the ordered() function.<br>
                                                                                            <span class=""><img src="rpics\21.jpg" alt="" style="width:100%;"/></span></li>

Next we want to analyze ridership data by type and weekday. We first create a ‘weekday’ column, then we group it by user type, we summarize the ‘number_of_riders’, we then create an ‘average_duration’ by averaging ‘ride_length’ and arrange them by ‘member_casual’ and ‘weekday’<br>
                                                                                                <span class=""><img src="rpics\22.jpg" alt="" style="width:100%;"/></span></li>

                                                                                                    <span class=""><img src="rpics\23.jpg" alt="" /></span></li>
                                                                                                    <li>Now we use ggplot to visualize the average duration of rides, this time we answer the question “What is the differences between casual and member riders, based on the duration of their rides?”<br>
                                                                                                        <span class=""><img src="rpics\24.jpg" alt="" /></span>Now we use ggplot to visualize the average duration of rides, this time we answer the question “What is the differences between casual and member riders, based on the duration of their rides?”</li>

We put the data we want into a new data frame ‘counts’ using the aggregate function, then we export a CSV file to the directory what we want. <br>
                                                                                                            <span class=""><img src="rpics\25.jpg" alt="" style="width:100%;"/></span></li>
