                            <h2>Background</h2>
                            <p>Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering in 2016. The bikes are convenience and easy to use. 
                            The pricing plans include single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. 
                            Annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. 
                            Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. 
                            Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, 
                            the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, 
                            why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics.</p>

                            <h2>Preparation</h2>
                            <p>We used Cyclistic’s historical trip data to analyze and identify trends. 
                                All data are organized and located locally. All data has been reviewed for biases.
